# 👋 Hi, I'm Sebastian

💻 **Java Backend Developer** | ☕ **Spring Boot** | 🤖 **AI & Algorithms** | 🧪 **Clean Code & Testing**

I build modern Java backends focused on **performance**, **clean architecture**, and **testability**. I enjoy solving real-world problems with algorithms, designing secure APIs, and integrating AI into classic backend systems.

## 🚀 Project Philosophy

My projects are built around a few consistent principles:

- **Real-world motivation** – I turn everyday problems (shopping, cooking, self-presentation) into engineering challenges.
- **Learning by building** – each project is designed to explore a specific area: algorithms, performance, security, AI, or deployment.
- **Engineering trade-offs** – I consciously balance correctness, performance, and maintainability (e.g. heuristics instead of brute force).
- **Clean architecture** – readable code, clear responsibilities, modular design, and documented APIs.
- **AI as a tool** – AI is integrated where it adds value and remains configurable and replaceable.

My goal is to build systems that are **useful, understandable, and easy to evolve**, while continuously improving my backend engineering skills.
